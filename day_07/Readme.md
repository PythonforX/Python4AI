# ðŸ”¥ Week 1 ðŸ”¥ | Grand Challenge | Personal Finance Manager

## Description:
Create a Personal Finance Manager that helps users track their income, expenses, and savings. The system should support the following operations:
1. **Add a Transaction**:
    - Prompt the user for transaction details (date, description, amount, type [income/expense]).
    - Store the details in a dictionary and add it to the list of transactions.

2. **View Transactions**:
    - Display all transactions or filter by a specified date range.
    - Use formatted output to display the transactions.

3. **View Summary**:
    - Calculate and display the total income, total expenses, and net savings.

4. **Search Transactions**:
    - Allow the user to search for a transaction by description or amount.
    - Display the matching transactions if found.

5. **Save and Load Data**:
    - Save the transaction records to a file.
    - Load the transaction records from a file.

6. **Custom Module (`finance_utils.py`)**:
    - Implement utility functions for common tasks (e.g., input validation, date formatting). Develop the module by yourself

7. **Error Handling**:
    - Handle errors gracefully using try-except blocks.
